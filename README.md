## Iterating well with purrr (Thursday June 13)

Slides:

  * [PDF](purrr-2024.pdf) here in this repo

Jenny live code:

   * If the Computer Gods smile upon us, my live code will be available to you
     in the browser.
   * [pos.it/jenny-live-code](https://pos.it/jenny-live-code) *new link, but I
     think/hope it's working well*
   * [rstd.io/jenny-live-code](https://rstd.io/jenny-live-code) *old link, but
     seems to still work*

More places to learn about purrr and iteration:

  * The [Iteration chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/iteration) of R for Data
    Science 2e *this has the most "current" take on where purrr fits within the
    tidyverse, especially w.r.t. dplyr and tidyr*
  * The [purrr 1.0.0 blog post](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2022/12/purrr-1-0-0/) (December 2022)
  describes a major milestone for purrr, i.e. that its overall scope and API is
  stable.
  * [purrr tutorial](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/) *caveat: this is
    somewhat dated, but there is still valuable content here*
  * [Row-oriented workflows in R with the tidyverse](https://github.com/jennybc/row-oriented-workflows#readme)  *caveat:
    this is somewhat dated, but there is still valuable content here*
  * tidyr's [Rectangling vignette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/rectangle.html)
  * dplyr's [Row-wise operations vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/rowwise.html)
  * dplyr's [Column-wise operations vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/colwise.html)
