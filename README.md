## Iterating well with purrr (Thursday June 15)

Slides on SpeakerDeck:

  * <https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/purrr-workshop>
  * I'll be speaking from a modified version of those slides, but those are pretty close if you want to have a file open locally.

Jenny live code:

  * [rstd.io/jenny-live-code](https://rstd.io/jenny-live-code) *This currently
    holds code from a previous workshop, about a different topic, but I hope to
    re-use this approach again for RaukR 2023.*
  * *note: I've switched to an rstd.io shortlink, not bit.ly!*

More places to learn about purrr and and iteration:

  * The [Iteration chapter](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/iteration.html) of R for Data
    Science 2e *this has the most "current" take on where purrr fits within the
    tidyverse, especially w.r.t. dplyr and tidyr*
  * [purrr tutorial](https://jennybc.github.io/purrr-tutorial/) *caveat: this is
    somewhat dated, but there is still valuable content here*
  * [Row-oriented workflows in R with the tidyverse](https://github.com/jennybc/row-oriented-workflows#readme)  *caveat:
    this is somewhat dated, but there is still valuable content here*

## Package development (Friday June 16)

* The Whole Game: creating a small package from scratch.
